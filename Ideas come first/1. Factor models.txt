When I think of factors, FF 5 factor model is a great start!
What can be added and are they really needed?
Lets try!

1. What do we have after deleting 5 factors and Momentum factor?
2. Is the residual low enough?
3. What about other fundamental features? Do they create systematic factors?
4. What does BARRA do?
5. Afterall, we can use it to get the covariance estimates.
